# SearchMate

SearchMate is CLI tool that helps in searching the equivalent content over the internet by taking reference of a document (.txt,.pdf,.docx) and list down the URL with their appropriate find scores.

## Features!

  - Fetchs links of web pages related to provided content.
  - Many of them aren't even ranked properly on google. So, it will help in exploring 
    some **rare treasures**!
  - Colorful CLI will help in better understanding of the things.
  - It can accept multiple formats of the file containing your content like `.txt`, `.docx`,
   `.pdf`(containg text and not text on images).
  - `Find Score` feartures lets you know how much of text in that link matchs yours.
  - Save results in a `.txt` file so you can refer it later.
  - You can store the output which is by default named `results.txt` in the path you wish,

  the internet by taking reference of a document(.txt,.pdf,.docx) and list
  down the URL with their appropriate find scores.

  Example: python main.py -f input/file/path -o output/path

Options:
  -f, --filename PATH          Path to the file
  -o, --output_directory PATH  Where to place the results. Default = Current

```sh
$ python main.py -f file_name
```
After executing the above command, the links will be fetched and stored in the same
directory with the file name `results.txt`as well as displayed on the terminal.
For demo purpose, a file named `query.txt` is already there.

If you wish to store the results in a **specific path**, you'll need to execute the
following command instead.
```sh
$ python main.py -f file_name -o your_path
```
it will redirect the output to whatever path you've mentioned with the default file name.

There is also a faq section, you can check it out! 
```sh
